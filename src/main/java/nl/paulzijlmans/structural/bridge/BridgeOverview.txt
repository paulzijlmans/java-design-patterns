Adapter

Concepts
- Decouple Abstraction and implementation
- Encapsulation, Composition, Inheritance
- Changes in Abstraction won’t affect client
- Details won’t be right
- Examples:
  ▪ Driver
  ▪ JDBC

Design
- Interfaces and Abstract classes
- Composition over Inheritance
- More than Composition
- Expect change from both sides
- Abstraction, Implementor, Refined Abstraction, Concrete Implementor

Pitfalls
- Increases complexity
- Conceptually difficult to plan
- More than just OO
- What goes where

Summary
- Design for uncertainty
- Can be complex
- Provides flexibility
- More than composition
