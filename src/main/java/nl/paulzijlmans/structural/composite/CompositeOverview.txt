Adapter

Concepts
- Components represent part or whole structure
- Compose objects into tree structures
- Individual object treated as a Composite
- Same operations applied on individual and composites
- Examples:
  ▪ java.awt.Component
  ▪ JSF widgets
  ▪ RESTful service GETs

Design
- Tree structured
- Component
- Leaf or Composite, same operations
- Composite knows about child objects
- Component, Leaf, Composite

Pitfalls
- Can overly simplify system
- Difficult to restrict
- Implementation can possibly be costly

Summary
- Generalizes a hierarchical structure
- Can simplify things too much
- Easier for clients
- Composite != Composition
