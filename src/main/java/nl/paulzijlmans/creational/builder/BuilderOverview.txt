Builder

Concepts
- Handles complex constructors
- Large number of parameters
- Immutability
- Examples:
  ▪ StringBuilder
  ▪ DocumentBuilder
  ▪ Locale.Builder

Design
- Flexibility over telescoping constructors
- Static inner class
- Calls appropriate constructor
- Negates the need for exposed setters
- Java 1.5+ can take advantage of Generics

Pitfalls
- Immutable
- Inner static class
- Designed first
- Complexity
- Method returns object

Summary
- Creative way to deal with complexity
- Easy to implement
- Few drawbacks
- Can refactor in with separate class
